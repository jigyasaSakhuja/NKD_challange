The Problem:
store plans to open between 90-120 new stores every year. Acquisition managers will receive several thousand offers of potential ‘prospect stores’ each year. They need to assess each prospect store location and decide if they wish to open a store there. If a newly opened store makes less than approximately €350k gross turnover a year it typically will be a loss-making store. 
The focus of this problem is twofold:
•	To determine what location factors are indicative that a new store will be successful.
•	To come up with a strategy/process for assessing if a new prospect store will be successful and rejecting stores that are likely to fail.
